### Explanation of **Auth ID** Generation:

In the code, the **Auth ID** is generated using the `generateAuthID` function in `app.js`. The process is as follows:

1. **Random String Generation**: 
   - The function generates a random string using JavaScript's `Math.random()` method, which creates a random number between 0 and 1.
   - This number is then converted to a base-36 string (which uses letters and numbers). The `substr(2, 10)` method is used to take the substring starting from the 3rd character to the 12th character, ensuring that the string is unique but not too long.

2. **Prefix**: 
   - The string `'auth-'` is prepended to the generated random string to create the **Auth ID**. This ensures that the identifier has a recognizable format.

So, an example output could be something like `auth-p6wy5hqk4n`. This string is guaranteed to be unique because it is based on a randomly generated number, and the chances of generating the same random string twice are extremely low.
