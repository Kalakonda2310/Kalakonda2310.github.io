# Privacy-Preserving Fingerprint Authentication

This project simulates a privacy-preserving fingerprint authentication system, demonstrating how fingerprint data can be securely stored and matched using hashing. It uses a simple in-memory system for simulating the enrollment and authentication of fingerprint data while maintaining privacy by storing only hashed versions of fingerprints.

## Features

- **Enrollment Process**: Users can enroll their fingerprint, which is captured and hashed. A unique "Auth ID" is generated for each user during enrollment.
- **Authentication Process**: Users can authenticate by entering their "Auth ID", which is then used to verify the hashed fingerprint stored in the system.
- **Privacy Preservation**: The system only stores a hashed version of the fingerprint for authentication purposes, ensuring the original fingerprint data is not directly accessible or stored.
- **Simulated Fingerprint Capture**: For the purpose of this demo, fingerprint data is simulated as random strings. In a real-world application, actual fingerprint data would be captured via hardware devices.

### 1. `index.html`
The HTML file provides the basic structure for the user interface (UI). It includes:
- A form to input the "Auth ID" for authentication.
- Buttons for enrolling a fingerprint and authenticating with an existing "Auth ID".
- A status section to display messages like successful enrollment, authentication results, or errors.

### 2. `app.js`
The JavaScript file contains the logic for:
- Generating a unique "Auth ID" for each user.
- Simulating the capture of a fingerprint.
- Hashing the fingerprint using the SHA-256 algorithm.
- Storing the hashed fingerprint in an in-memory database (`outsourcedDB`) and the raw fingerprint for matching (`fingerprintStore`).
- Authenticating a user by comparing the entered "Auth ID" with the stored hash, and matching the fingerprint hash.

## How it Works

1. **Enrollment**:
   - The user clicks on the "Enroll Fingerprint" button, which triggers the `enroll()` function.
   - A simulated fingerprint is captured, hashed, and stored along with a randomly generated "Auth ID".
   - The system responds with the success message and displays the generated "Auth ID", which the user will use for authentication later.

2. **Authentication**:
   - The user enters their "Auth ID" and clicks the "Authenticate" button.
   - The system retrieves the stored fingerprint hash using the "Auth ID" and compares it with the hash of the current (simulated) fingerprint.
   - If the hashes match, authentication is successful; otherwise, it fails.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the repository

Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fingerprint-authentication.git
```

### 2. Open the `index.html` file in a browser

Simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser to run the project locally. The app does not require any server-side configuration for this simulation, as everything runs directly in the browser using JavaScript.

### 3. Interact with the App

- Click on the "Enroll Fingerprint" button to simulate fingerprint enrollment.
- Enter the "Auth ID" generated from the enrollment step to test authentication.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Basic structure for the user interface.
- **CSS**: Simple styling to make the interface clean and user-friendly.
- **JavaScript**: Logic for fingerprint simulation, hashing, and authentication.

## Simulated Components

- **Fingerprint Simulation**: For demonstration purposes, fingerprints are simulated using random strings. In a real-world application, biometric hardware (e.g., fingerprint scanners) would be required to capture actual fingerprint data.
- **Hashing**: The fingerprint is hashed using the Web Crypto API's `crypto.subtle.digest()` method, which provides secure hashing (SHA-256) to ensure the fingerprint is stored securely.

## Security Notes

- In this simulation, the raw fingerprint is stored in memory (in the `fingerprintStore` object) for matching purposes. This is not a secure practice for production use, as the raw data could potentially be accessed.
- In a real-world scenario, only hashed fingerprints should be stored and compared, and additional security measures like encryption, secure communication, and proper access control should be implemented.

## Future Improvements

- **Real Biometric Integration**: Connect the system to a real biometric fingerprint scanner.
- **Server-Side Storage**: Implement server-side fingerprint storage with proper encryption and security measures.
- **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Integrate additional factors like PIN codes or face recognition for enhanced security.
